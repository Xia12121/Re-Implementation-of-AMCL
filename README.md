# Re-Implementation of Adaptive Multi-head Contrastive Learning
This project contains my comprehension of this paper and the re-implementation of the experimental code. My code is various from original work because the lib version is different from the source code. This project is based on [Wang's work](https://github.com/LeiWangR/cl).
