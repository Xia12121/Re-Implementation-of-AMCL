# Re-Implementation of Adaptive Multi-head Contrastive Learning
This project contains my comprehension of this paper and the re-implementation of the experimental code. My code is various from original work because the lib version is different from the source code. This project is based on [Wang's work](https://github.com/LeiWangR/cl).

## I. Research Background and Motivation
In contrastive learning, two views generated by various augmentations from same original image are considered Positive Pair. And two view generated from different images are considered Negative Pair. For contrastive learning, people hope the similarity between positive pair to be high and similarity between negative pair to be low.

However, due to the diversity of augmentations views generated from same image may be quite different and views generated from various images may be similar with each other.
